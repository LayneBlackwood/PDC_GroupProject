As you step into the dimly lit electronics store, the hum of outdated televisions fills the air. Shelves are lined with gadgets and devices, each with a layer of dust that speaks of forgotten times. You hear a voice from the back, a low, menacing tone, "You shouldn't have come here." A store worker emerges from behind a stack of obsolete consoles, eyes gleaming with intent. The neon lights flicker ominously as the worker blocks your path, ready to challenge you. The faint buzz of old arcade machines serves as the only soundtrack to this battle. What do you do?

The scent of expensive perfume lingers as you push through the glass doors of the upscale clothing boutique. Mannequins dressed in the latest fashion trends stare at you with lifeless eyes. You feel the presence before you see it—a worker steps out from behind a curtain, fabric shears gleaming in the store's soft lighting. "You're not just browsing, are you?" they sneer, brandishing their tools with expert precision. The soft melody of background music clashes with the rising tension, turning this peaceful boutique into an unexpected battleground. What do you do?

Brightly colored toys and stuffed animals surround you as you enter the toy store, but the cheerful atmosphere feels like a trap. The worker behind the counter watches you with a smile that doesn’t reach their eyes. "Looking for something fun?" they ask, but there's a challenge hidden in their words. Suddenly, the once-friendly toys seem to loom larger, their shadows cast long by the overhead lights. The worker steps forward, toys in hand, and you realize that this place of joy has turned into a twisted playground where only one of you will leave unscathed. What do you do?

The aroma of different cuisines wafts through the air as you walk through the food court, but your appetite vanishes as you notice the intense gaze of a worker from one of the stalls. They step forward, wiping their hands on a stained apron, eyes locked on you. "You’re about to get a taste of something you won’t forget," they say, reaching for a kitchen utensil that doubles as a weapon. The clatter of dishes and distant conversations fade as the entire food court seems to narrow down to just the two of you, ready to face off in this unexpected culinary clash.

After surviving the previous battles, the atmosphere in the mall changes. The once-bustling halls are eerily silent as you approach the grand atrium. A figure stands in the center, cloaked in darkness. The lights flicker, revealing the imposing presence of the mall's final guardian—the Dark Knight. This isn’t just any worker; this is the enforcer of the mall's twisted order, wielding a weapon forged from the essence of every store you’ve conquered. "Your journey ends here," the Dark Knight declares, their voice echoing through the empty corridors. This is the final test—defeat the Dark Knight, or be consumed by the mall's never-ending night.
